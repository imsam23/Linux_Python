Adapter pattern:
    a fundamental structural design pattern, bridges the gap between incompatible interfaces,
    enabling objects with different interfaces to collaborate seamlessly.

Key Components:
    Adaptee: An existing class with an incompatible interface.
    Adapter: A class that wraps the Adaptee and provides a compatible interface.
    Client: The class that relies on the Adaptee but needs to use it through the Adapter's compatible interface.
