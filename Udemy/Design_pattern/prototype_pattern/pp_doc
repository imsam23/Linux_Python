"""

Here's an explanation of the Prototype pattern in Python, along with an example:

Purpose:

Creates new objects by cloning existing ones, rather than through direct construction.
Useful when object creation is expensive or complex, or when you want to customize objects without affecting their prototypes.
Key Components:

Prototype: A base class or interface that declares a cloning method (usually clone()).
Concrete Prototypes: Classes that implement the Prototype interface and provide specific cloning functionality.
Client: Code that uses the Prototype to create new objects by cloning.
