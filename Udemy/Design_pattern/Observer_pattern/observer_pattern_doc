Purpose:

Establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects, where one object (the Subject) notifies multiple other objects (the Observers) about changes in its state.
Decouples the Subject from the Observers, promoting loose coupling and flexibility.
Key Components:

Subject:
Maintains a list of Observers.
Provides methods for Observers to attach and detach themselves.
Notifies Observers when its state changes.
Observer:
Defines an update() method that the Subject calls when notifying changes.
